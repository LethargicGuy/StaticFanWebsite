            <h3>Storyline after IW(2018)</h3>
            <p>After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe.

The grave course of events set in motion by Thanos that wiped out half the universe and fractured the Avengers ranks compels the remaining Avengers to take one final stand in Marvel Studios' grand conclusion to twenty-two films, Avengers: Endgame.</p>
            <h3>Cast</h3>
            <ul>
           <li> Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man: 
               The leader and benefactor of the Avengers who is a self-described genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist with electromechanical suits of armor of his own making.</li>
<li>Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America: 
    A fugitive superhero and leader of a faction of Avengers. A World War II veteran, he was enhanced to the peak of human physicality by an experimental serum and frozen in suspended animation before waking up in the modern world.[5] Although the film was beyond Evans' initial six-film contract with Marvel which would have ended with Avengers: Infinity War, Evans agreed to appear in the film "because it made sense. It's going to wrap everything up.</li>
<li>Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / Hulk: 
    An Avenger and a genius scientist who, because of exposure to gamma radiation, transforms into a monster when enraged or agitated.[7] The character concludes a story arc that was established in Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Infinity War.</li>
<li>Chris Hemsworth as Thor: 
    An Avenger and the king of Asgard, based on the Norse mythological deity of the same name.[5] Thor now wields a mystical axe known as Stormbreaker, after the destruction of his hammer Mjolnir in Thor: Ragnarok.</li>

<li>Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton:

<li>Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel: 
    An ex-U.S. Air Force pilot whose DNA was altered during an accident, which imbues her with the powers of superhuman strength, energy projection and flight. Co-screenwriter Christopher Markus stated that Danvers' powers are on a scale that has not previously existed in the MCU and likened her personality to Rogers', "which is sort of a person who's right and knows they're right and doesn't really want to hear it when you tell them they're wrong".</li>

<li>Josh Brolin as Thanos: 
    An intergalactic despot from Titan who collected the six Infinity Stones to inflict his will on all of reality.[26][27] Co-director Joe Russo said that after the events of Avengers: Infinity War, "[Thanos has] succeeded in the thing he has set out to do. He's done. He did it. He's retired."[28] In addition to providing the voice for the character, Brolin performed motion capture on set.</li>
